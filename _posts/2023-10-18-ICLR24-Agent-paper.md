This is a collection of recent papers submitted to ICLR'24, which are focusing on building autonomous agent. Here is how Wikipedia defines <i>Agent</i>:
These papers have been integrated to this [github repo](https://github.com/lafmdp/Awesome-Papers-Autonomous-Agent), which is in active maintainance. Feel free to star/follow the repo.


> In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an agent acting in an intelligent manner; It perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or acquiring knowledge. An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostator other control systemis considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.

The key of an agent is that it can achieve goals, acquire knowledge and continually improveme.

Specifically, this repo is interested in two types of agent: RL-based agent and LLM-based agent.
