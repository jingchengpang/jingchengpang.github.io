Greetings! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Yang Yu](https://www.wolai.com/eyounx/dtR1MTyRXS5tP5Cex4KtdK). In June 2019, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)). Subsequently, in September 2019, I joined the [LAMDA](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn) group at Nanjing University, led by Professor [Zhihua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/index.htm), as a Master's student, having been granted an exemption from the entrance examination. Since September 2021, I was fortunate to be accepted into the Successive Postgraduate and Doctoral program, enabling a smooth transition into my current Ph.D. studies.

My primary research interests lie in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). I am particularly focused on language-based agents, real-world applications, robotic execution, and improving the efficiency of RL algorithms. Free free to contact/follow me if you are interested in my work.
